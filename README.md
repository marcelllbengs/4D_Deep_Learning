# 4D_Deep_Learning


Here, we will publish our code for our paper on 4D deep learning for motion analysis using 4D US data. 

You can find the paper here: .....

You can find all the models in the model_lib.py file. 

This repository also contains an entire environment for training and evaluating models. Some example configs for that are given in the cfgs folder.
