# 4D_Deep_Learning


Here, we will publish our code for our paper on 4D deep learning for motion analysis using 4D US data. 

You can find the paper here: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10083305

You can find the code for the models in the model_lib.py file. 

Example configurations for the models are given in the cfg folder.
